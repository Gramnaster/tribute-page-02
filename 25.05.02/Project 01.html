                    Thomas Leo Clancy Jr. (April 12, 1947 – October 1, 2013) was an American novelist. He is best known for his technically detailed espionage and military-science storylines set during and after the Cold War. Seventeen of his novels have been bestsellers and more than 100 million copies of his books have been sold.[1] His name was also used on screenplays written by ghostwriters, nonfiction books on military subjects occasionally with co-authors, and video games. He was a part-owner of his hometown Major League Baseball team, the Baltimore Orioles, and vice-chairman of their community activities and public affairs committees. <br><br> Originally an insurance agent, Clancy launched his literary career in 1984 when he sold his first military thriller novel The Hunt for Red October for $5,000 published by the small academic Naval Institute Press of Annapolis, Maryland.[1][2] The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games (1987), Clear and Present Danger (1989), and The Sum of All Fears (1991) have been turned into commercially successful films. Tom Clancy's works also inspired games such as the Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell and The Division series. Since Clancy's death in 2013,[3] the Jack Ryan series has been continued by his family estate through a series of authors.

                <p class="detail">
                Clancy's first wife, Wanda Thomas King, was a nurse.[8][35] They married in 1969 and had four children.[1] The couple separated briefly in 1995, and they permanently separated in December 1996.[1][36] Wanda Clancy filed for divorce in November 1997,[37][38] which became final in January 1999.[39] As part of the divorce, she and Clancy split his minority stake in the Baltimore Orioles.[40]

                <br> <br> On June 26, 1999, Clancy married freelance journalist Alexandra Marie Llewellyn, whom he had met in 1997.[41] Llewellyn is the daughter of J. Bruce Llewellyn and a family friend of Colin Powell, who originally introduced the couple to each other.[42] They remained together until Clancy's death in October 2013.[43] They had one daughter.
                    
                <br> <br> Clancy was a Roman Catholic. The plot of his novel Red Rabbit revolves around John Paul II.[44] In a June 27, 1993, interview with The Washington Post, he was quoted as saying, "I've had [sex scenes] in my books before, but you had to look real fast because, you know, I'm a married Catholic and I don't do that."[45] In a 2002 interview with Lev Grossman for Time magazine, Clancy lamented what he perceived as society's double standard in the way Catholics are viewed by some people in society in relation to other demographic segments: "You can't hate black people any more, of course, and you can't hate homosexuals any more, but you can hate all the Catholics you want."[44]

                Clancy's 80-acre estate, which was once a summer camp, is located in Calvert County, Maryland. It has a panoramic view of the Chesapeake Bay.[46] The stone mansion, which cost $2 million, has 24 rooms and features a shooting range in the basement.[35][46] The property also features a World War II–era M4 Sherman tank, a Christmas gift from his first wife.[46][47]

                <br> <br> Clancy also purchased a 17,000-square-foot penthouse condominium in the Ritz-Carlton, in Baltimore's Inner Harbor, for $16 million.[10] Clancy and his wife combined four units to create the apartment.[48]

                <br> <br> His Chesapeake Bay estate sold for $4.9 million in 2020.[49]

                <p class="detail">
                A long-time proponent of conservative and Republican views, Clancy dedicated books to American conservative political figures, including Ronald Reagan. A week after the September 11 attacks, Clancy suggested on The O'Reilly Factor that American left-wing politicians were partly responsible for the failure to prevent the attacks due to their "gutting" of the Central Intelligence Agency.

                <br> <br> On September 11, 2001, Clancy was interviewed by Judy Woodruff on CNN.[30] During the interview, he noted that orthodox "Islam does not permit suicide." Among other observations during this interview, Clancy cited discussions he had with military experts on the lack of planning to deal with a hijacked plane being used in a suicide attack and criticized the news media's treatment of the United States Intelligence Community. Clancy appeared again on PBS's Charlie Rose, to discuss the implications of the day's events with Richard Holbrooke, New York Times journalist Judith Miller, and Senator John Edwards, among others.[31] Clancy was interviewed on those shows because his book Debt of Honor[32] (1994) included a scenario wherein a disgruntled Japanese airline pilot crashes a fueled Boeing 747 into the U.S. Capitol dome during an address by the President to a joint session of Congress, killing the President and most of Congress. In the book, Clancy also implies that Japan's prosperity is due primarily to unequal trading terms.[33] In the book's sequel Executive Orders (1996), the president announces a new foreign policy doctrine, under which the United States will hold personally accountable any foreign leader who orders attacks on U.S. citizens, territory, or possessions in the future.[34]

                <br> <br> Numerous scholars have examined the political dimensions of Clancy's books, especially in the context of the Cold War. Historian Walter Hixson has argued that Clancy's novels, especially The Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising, were "popular representations of Reagan-era Cold War values. They reflect both popular perceptions of Soviet behavior and the predominant national security values of the Reagan era."
